############         A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PACKAGE        ############
###########################################################################

The current package contains the most recent version of the TeX Gyre
Adventor family of fonts in the PostScript Type 1 and OpenType formats.
TeX Gyre Adventor is based on the URW Gothic L kindly released
by URW++ Design and Development Inc. under GFL (independently of the GPL
release accompanying Ghostscript). The Vietnamese glyphs were added
by Han The Thanh. The Greek (basic) alphabet programmed for the TeX Gyre
Adventor was inspired by the Kerkis package
(http://iris.math.aegean.gr/kerkis/).

----- qag-hist.txt
Ver 2.003: 16.09.2009
* this is the first official release of the TeX Gyre Adventor fonts since
  June 22, 2009, when URW++, represented by Dr. Peter Rosenfeld, its
  Managing Director, kindly agreed to release the original 35 base
  PostScript fonts as shipped with Ghostscript ver. 4.00 under the LPPL
  (LaTeX Project Public License). This should be understood so that the
  35 base Postscript fonts may be used and developed either under the
  LPPL or one of the GPL (GNU Public Licence) or AFPL (Aladdin Free
  Public Licence). The latter were put in force with the initial release
  of the base fonts with Ghostscript ver. 4.00 in 1996. Hereby we thank
  Dr. Rosenfeld. The TeX Gyre fonts are being develped from the
  Ghostscript ver. 4.00 base. For reasons explained elsewhere, we prefer
  to provide our work under the GUST Font Licence (GFL) which is legally
  equivallent to the LPPL. However, since 1996 the 35 PostScript base
  fonts were enhanced under the GNU Public License with Vietnamese glyphs
  by Han The Thanh and Cyrillic glyphs by Valek Filippov. Han The Thanh
  kindly permitted his additions to be retained under under GFL/LPPL in
  this and future TeX Gyre fonts releases. Unfortunately, we were unable
  to receive a similar permission from Valek Filippov for his Cyrillic
  glyphs, thus there are no Cyrillic glyphs in any of the TeX Gyre fonts.
