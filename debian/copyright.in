This package was debianized by Norbert Preining <preining@debian.org> on
Thu, 23 Aug 2007 18:38:31 +0200.

The following TeX Live packages were downloaded from 
    http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/archive/
and merged into one orig.tar.gz file:
    tex-gyre.tar.xz
    tex-gyre.doc.tar.xz
    tex-gyre-math.tar.xz
    tex-gyre-math.doc.tar.xz
This is done with the script debian/make-orig-tar
